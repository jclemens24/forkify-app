Unfortunately, I had issues during the build process when deploying to Netlify. Previously, I had utilized the [Fraction.js](https://github.com/infusion/Fraction.js/) library to render recipe ingredient quantities in a more user-friendly manner. However, this library failed to be installed several times during the build process so I removed that dependency for the time-being. I hope you enjoy the application.
