Unfortunately, I had issues during the build process when deploying to Netlify. Previously, I had utilized the Fraction.js library to render recipe ingredient quantities in a more user-friendly manner. However, this library failed to be installed several times during the build process so I removed that dependency for the time-being. I hope you enjoy the application.
